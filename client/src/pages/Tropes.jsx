<p> You know the guy. Or girl.</p>
<p>If there's a strange noise, That Guy will investigate it without delay.</p>
<p>If there is a suspicious character, That Guy will not only trust them unconditionally, but will get offended on behalf of that character when others point out their suspicions.</p>
<p>They call out 'Hello?' and 'Is there someone there?' to every potential threat.</p>
<p>That Guy assumes every inexplicable voice-like sound heard calling out is a human who 'might need our help'.</p>
<p>That Guy is convinced it's time to split up.</p>
<p>In the middle of a tense unfolding situation, That Guy partakes in inappropriately relaxing activities, such as listening to music, watching TV, bathing, napping, or sex.</p>
<p>That Guy doesn't tell anyone where he's going.</p>
<p>No matter what the task is, That Guy always assumes it'll only take 'a couple of minutes'.</p>
<p>If That Guy is in the middle of a desperate task, and confronted by a pursuing monster, he chooses to continue at his desperate task, but faster.</p>
<p>That Guy angrily kicks, throws, or breaks things when they fail to work the first time, thereby guaranteeing they are irrepairably broken.</p>
<p>That Guy fails to pack extra ammo, assured the amount loaded into the gun will be enough.</p>
<p>In close quarters, That Guy bashes an enemy with the butt of a pistol instead of firing it...</p>
<p>...when that doesn't work, That Guy tosses the gun away, and flees, instead of firing it.</p>
<p>That Guy assumes the monster is incontrovertibly dead, and doesn't consider it might be unconsciousness, stunned, asleep, or playing dead.</p>

<p>WHY TROPES AND CLICHES CAN BE BAD.</p>
<p>The 'dumb' horror character who practically walks headlong into an obvious trap or perilous situation is known to anyone who has seen a horror film.</p>
<p>WHY IS HORROR PROLIFERATE WITH CLICHES?</p>
<p>THE BENEFIT OF WRITING ORIGINAL - NON CLICHE - MATERIAL</p>

<p>It’s been said a story should focus on the characters who stand to lose the most, or have the most at stake. We like to hear stories about people who have something to lose—family, careers, ideals, opportunities, reputations, realistic hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>It should be noted that generally humans value ideas over physical realities, and a story will be more interesting if those ideas are the things at stake. The potential loss of reputation hits harder than the potential loss of a house or car.</p>
<p>A character who has nothing to lose is limiting, static and ineffective. For instance, a homeless alcoholic who shambles aimlessly from one day to the next, recklessly inviting death, makes a poor character. Similarly, you rarely see suicidal protagonists, because there are no stakes and no conflict. In real life, such people may have very interesting and moving stories, but for the purpose of fiction writing, they make weak characters. There is nothing of value in these characters for the reader to latch onto, because by the next chapter they could very well be dead.  </p>

<h5>7.1.1 	Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</h5>
<p>Good story ideas are squandered because of a weak choice of protagonist.</p>
<p>In Tom Stoppard’s absurdist play ‘Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead,’ the titular bit parts from Shakespeare’s Hamlet are the main characters; the play makes fun of the fact that their entire existence and designation is to be side characters in Hamlet – outside of which, they don’t properly ‘exist.’ The play recognizes that it’s absurd to pretend that by ‘shifting the camera’ those characters become the protagonists in their own story, and their stories are as equally important as Hamlet's to tell. Saying the side characters have stories that are not being told is as absurd as saying you would have won a race if only the winner had switched places with you.</p>

<h2 id="post-4-2" className="blog-post-title">4.2: The Grave Warning</h2>

<p>You already know this one. It’s in virtually every horror movie, every horror novel, almost every campfire ghost story. You have likely encountered it many times. Basically, a character says something to the effect of “Don’t go in there!”</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p className='indent-text-1'>
X: "Where are you heading?"<br></br>
Y: "I'm staying in Slains Hotel tonight."<br></br>
X: "Slains Hotel? You know what they say about that place? It's haunted. Don't stay there, I have a feeling bad things will happen."<br></br>
</p>

<p>In real life, most strangers have less concern for some person who stays in X hotel, or hikes in X woods, or goes swimming in X misty lake. So unless the person actually has a serious reason or interest in the person to care, it’s going to come off as a case of ‘I-only-exist-to-be-cryptically-afraid-for-you’ syndrome. </p>
<p>Counter Example:</p>
<p>In Stephen King's short story '1408',<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Olin the haunted hotel owner does have a real stake in what happens to the protagonist supernatural investigator, Enslin, because as he makes clear, he's the one who will have to clean up any mess left behind, and every time someone dies in the haunted room, it's a potential hit for his hotel's reputation and business. So his warning to Enslin comes off as genuine and supported by his character's motivations.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>An effective way of inserting 'the warning' by implication is in the short story 'The Border-Line Case':</p><a href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a>
<p className='indent-text-1'>
<i>
"Is it your first visit to Ireland?" asked Mr Doherty, still anxious to please, pouring out the whisky.<br></br>
"Yes, it is, she told him. "I'm rather ashamed I've never been over before. My grandfather was Irish. I'm sure the scenery is lovely around here. I must do some exploring tomorrow, down by the lake." She glanced across the bar, and was aware of the postmaster's eye upon her.</i></p>
<p>Here, instead of a warning, there is a watchful pause, which creates a sense of foreboding without creating exaggerated alarm.</p>

<p>Another problem is that if the ‘stranger’ gives a fair warning, you risk the protagonist looking like an idiot if he goes ahead and disregards it, and comes to some bad end. This is why the ‘stranger’s’ warning is often provided via ‘cryptic hints’ (see below), to (cheaply) create plausible denial over protagonist’s failure to take the warning seriously: because the protag didn’t realize it was warning.</p>
<p>Unless your ‘stranger’ has genuine concern, think of creative alternatives to this scenario. Backflipping from this trope is an effective way to unsettle the reader, because they are so used to strangers giving these kinds of warnings (admit it; in every horror, you expect at least one instance of it). </p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>In Pet Sematary,<a href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> not only does Judd <i>not</i> warn Louis away from visiting the burial ground, he actually offers to show Louis to it, and even how to use it. This serves an unusual, and more interesting, example of 'the warning', as by showing Louis where the burial ground is, and how it works, Judd intends to educate Louis on why it should <i>not</i> be used, and ensure Louis does not stumble upon - and use it - by accident.</p>

<p>But you don’t have to go as far as having your protagonist led by the hand to the source of horror, try to think of some other creative way of increasing suspense without any smack-in-the-face obviousness, e.g. - </p>

<p className='indent-text-1'><i>
X: “Where are you heading?”<br></br>
Y: “I’m going camping on Fog Mountain.”<br></br>
X: “Yeah? I know the place. Weren’t you up there last year?”<br></br>
Y: “No, never been.”<br></br>
X: “You sure? I could swear I remember you coming up. Or someone who looked just like you. Said you’d never come back.”
</i></p>

<p>Or - </p>

<p className='indent-text-1'><i>
X: “Where are you heading?”<br></br>
Y: “I’m going diving in Deadwood Lake.”<br></br>
X: “Sounds like fun. I shuttle between Elmville and Mapledale regularly. Always pass the lake. But I’ve never stopped there. Not once. Never seen anyone swimming either. You enjoy yourself.” <br></br>
</i></p>

<h2 id="post-4-3" className="blog-post-title">4.3: Misfortune Telling</h2>
<p>This is where the narrator jumps into third-person omniscient and predicts the doom of a character.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p className='indent-text-1'><i>Tommy slid a Dunhill out of the packet, lit up and took a drag, all the while not knowing that he had less than six hours to live.</i><a href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>You don’t see it as much in fiction today (or I would hope not). I think most writers realise its gimmicky, it’s jarring (particularly if you’re not otherwise using third-person omniscient), and a cynical way to maintain interest. You’re basically saying, ‘I know you’re bored right now, but just wait, something nail-biting is going to happen in a few pages’. If your story has a boring part, you can’t wand-wave it away by saying a character will die in ten pages. You have to make the scene itself interesting.</p>

<h2 id="post-4-4" className="blog-post-title">4.4: Cryptic Hints</h2>
<p>Holy shit, is this overused. I said ‘The Grave Warning’ cliché was overdone, but this is ridiculous. You not only see this one in horror, you see it anywhere with so much of a modicum of mystery. This is where characters convey important information in riddles rather than simply giving the facts straight up. Like ‘The Grave Warning’, it’s a cheap, gimmicky way to create suspense and/or intrigue without actually doing much work. It also detracts from realism, as no one talks in riddles in real life – particularly if a situation is really dire or urgent.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p className='indent-text-1'><i>
“The Mother,” Marie said. <br></br>
“What?” <br></br>
“The statue you’re staring at. It’s of the Mother.” <br></br>
“Who’s that?” <br></br>
“A very old goddess.” <br></br>
“Oh. What about this?” I pointed my knife at the road. <br></br>
“That takes you to a city.” <br></br>
“A city?” <br></br>
“A city by the sea,” she said. “I don’t think you’d care to visit it.” <br></br>
“By the sea?” <br></br>
“It’s different here.” <br></br>
“What does that mean?” <br></br>
“You’ll see,” she said, and crossed the road.<br></br>
  </i><a href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Consider, in that entire exchange, how much of it was coherent?</p>
<p>You have to wonder why writers keep employing this trope. As much as they love making up these enigmas, funny enough, readers hate reading them.</p>

<h2 id="post-4-5" className="blog-post-title">4.5: Shorthand Research</h2>
<p>This is where a character acquires info about some obscure or weird (or any) subject through googling it (or similar resource). For instance, a character may intend to stay at a hotel with a reputation for being haunted, so they google the incidents that have allegedly happened there. The problem is that it’s highly expository and just about the most sterile, uncompelling way to deliver information. The internet is a neutral presence in a story; it’s only capable of exposition, not interaction, characterisation and plot advancement – it’s not a ‘character’ or a ‘plot event’, the narrator may as well just tell the reader straight up.</p>
<p>A better way of conveying information is through actual events and/or character dialogue, e.g. rather than stopping to google the groundkeeper’s death on their iPhone, you could have a character pass a funeral service and their friend volunteers: </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p className='indent-text-1'><i>“Mr Roger. Fifty years of service keeping the Banes Road Manor courtyard tidy. Gosh. What on earth drove him to take his life like that?”</i></p>
<p>There are a number of advantages to this:</p>
<p className='purple-bold'>(a) The character has a right of reply:</p>
<p>This permits an interesting back and forth which gives the opportunity for character development (on both sides), as how characters deliver information and receive it depends on their personalities;</p>

<p className='purple-bold'>(b) The source of info is not neutral:</p>
<p>Unlike the internet, a second person has their own interests, biases and opinions which colour their perception. This can make an exchange more dynamic as the second person may selectively withhold info, or distort it.</p>
 
<h2 id="post-4-6" className="blog-post-title">4.6: False Scares</h2>
<p>A false scare is when something ostensibly scary happens, which subsequently turns out to be benign. For instance, there’s a screeching noise in the woods, which turns out to be a bat or an owl.</p>
<p>The most common false scare is when something scary happens which subsequently turns out to be a nightmare. This is so common it almost deserves to be its own category of bad horror trope.</p>

<h2 id="post-4-7" className="blog-post-title">4.7: It Was Just A Dream</h2>
<p>A simple rule: if it’s all just a bad dream, it’s all just a bad story. If the scariest thing that happens in your story is in a nightmare, then you’ve got trouble and your plot needs a defibrillator or something.</p>
<p>Dream sequences don’t do any work, and there are 3 main reasons why:</p>

<p className='purple-bold'>(1)	Nothing in dreams impacts the outside plot whatsoever:</p>
<p>Nothing that happens in a dream has any carry-over into real life, so essentially nothing in the dream matters for plot purposes.  </p>
<p className='purple-bold'>(2)	There are no stakes.</p>
<p>If a character is hurt or dies in a dream, they will awaken perfectly fine. </p>
<p className='purple-bold'>(3)	Just Thoughts in Pictures</p>
<p>A dream is not a setting which characters act and events happen. It’s totally removed from your in-story world. In a dream, we’re in the dreaming character’s head. So it’s just introspection conveyed through abstraction, symbols, and metaphors. Instead of a character thinking to themselves “I felt afraid”, it’s conveyed via, for instance, a dream chase scene. It’s just introspection via imagery.</p>

<p className='purple-bold'>(3)	Can't Get There from Here</p>
<p>Dreams lack causation from the real world, except for what the protagonist already had. For instance, if a protagonist appears to ‘learn’ something in a dream, they must have already known it. </p>

<p><u>Exceptions:</u></p>
<p>See the most famous exception to this trope: <i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i><a href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> It works because the story rules directly deal with and subvert these points. </p>
<p>(1) Characters can die in their dreams.</p>
<p>(2) The stakes in the dreams are even higher than in real life, because dreams expose the protagonist to the villain Freddy Krueger. It’s when they are <i>not</i> dreaming they are safe. So it’s when we enter a dream that things get <i>real.</i></p>
<p>(3) Although nothing in the dream is real except for the protagonist and Freddy Krueger, the dream content is not a product or representation of the dreamer’s mind, because Freddy controls the dream. This, interestingly, can create a ‘co-imagined’ setting with conflict between how the dreamer’s perceives reality, vs how Freddy perceives or manipulates it. These conflicts could potentially be used to create character development where a dreamer is challenged by a scene which does not resemble how they imagine it, and it detrimentally (or otherwise) affects their responding behavior in an unanticipated way, revealing true character. </p>
<p>(4) There is a thread of causation between the dreams and real world. Although characters cannot bring anything physical into their dreams, they could research the villain while awake and ‘bring’ that knowledge into their dreams to potentially use against him.</p>

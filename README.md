# Minesweeper

This is a personal project to create a react MERN stack app which has a number of simple games. These were built with ChatGPT help only. 

Games:
- [x] Minesweeper
- [ ] Solitaire
- [ ] Chess - would need an AI PC opponent
- [ ] Poker
- [ ] Slot Machine
- [ ] Pacman
- [ ] Frogger
- [ ] Flyswatting game
- [ ] Bad Toys 
- [ ] SideShow shooting gallery
- [ ] Go Fish, Uno, etc (would need AI PC opponent)

Others:

- solitaire
- chess
- poker
- slot machine
  - This would require points from other games to pay to play
- 'bad toys' type simple shooting game with reticule/flashpoint, 
  - Or sideshow type shooting gallery
- fly swat type game, 'gun' is a flyswatter
- pacman
- frogger

- pool (?)
- pinball (?)

Optional:
- type of virtual reward shop where you trade points for virtual stuff, e.g. user avatars, 'trophies'

Difficulty:

To change difficulty inside the game, you can change:
- GRID SIZE:
-         const rows = 10; const cols = 10 (change this to how big you want the grid to be)
- SAFE CELL REVEAL:
-         const maxReveal: default '3', change to alter how many blocks of cells get revealed when a safe cell is clicked
- MINE #:
- to edit number of mines change quantity in:
  -       const [nonBombCellsCount, setNonBombCellsCount] = useState(rows * cols - 5); <---- change the 5
  -       while (randomCells.length < 5) <----- change the 5

## Steps to creating Minesweeper:

1. <u>'const Grid'</u>: Create 5 x 5 grid
2. <u>'const generateInitialGrid'</u>: Give every cell a unique numerical id (in 5x5 from 1 - 25) displayed on each cell
3. <u>'const handleClick'</u>: Make every cell an event listener/clickable
4. <u>'const generateNewGrid'</u>: Make 3 random cells display 'X' instead of their numerical id (these will be the mines)
5. <u>'const updateAdjacentCells'</u>: Iterate through cell array again, check which # cell ids contain 'X's and attach an 'a' to cells that are X+1 or X-1 (e.g. if X is 15, then cells 14 and 16 will become 14a and 16a) these will be numerical 'proximity cells' 
   1. If cell is adjacent to two X/mines it will get two 'a's, i.e. 3 becomes 3aa
6. <u>'const updateAdjacentCells'</u>: For diagonal proximity cells
   1. Create diagonal relations  between cells and modify cell id based on diagonal link:
   -   ‚ÜñÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚ÜóÔ∏è
   -   ‚¨ÖÔ∏è üí£ ‚û°Ô∏è
   -   ‚ÜôÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚ÜòÔ∏è
   -   All above directional cells will get update of proximity values once mines are randomly inserted into grid
7. <u>'const handleClick'</u>: check which cells hold 'X's (mines) and switch the X to a üí£ if clicked
8. <u>'const nonBombCells'</u>: Create a constant that holds all cells minus the X/mine cells 
9.  <u>' setTimeout ' </u>: create an alert one clicking a mine creating 'game over screen' and game restarts
10. <u>'const handleClick'</u>: if one mine cell is clicked, all mine cells are revealed
11. <u>'generateInitialGrid' [...] content: '' revealed: false:</u>cells blank and unclicked at game start, <u>newGrid[rowIndex][colIndex].revealed = true:</u> once clicked, cell reveals proximity value

## TO DO: 

- [x] Grid
- [x] Event listening
- [x] Mines
- [x] Proximity dynamic
- [x] Remove Xs from mine cells
- [x] Clicking a mine = game over
- [x] Remove id visibility, switch to single number
- [x] non value cells (currently blank) update with styling change when clicked
- [x] blocks of non value cells get selected if one is 
- [x] CSS styling (bomb cell red, button depressed)
- [x] 3 difficulties, or difficulty options:
  - mimic actual game difficulty options 
  - grid size
  - mine number
  - probably adjusted by user through radio switch (if 'easy' then render game with 6x6 and xx # bombs etc)
- [x] right click applies flag, another removes flag
- [x] win alert triggers when all cells (minus bomb cells) have been revealed
- [x] user can save score and view high scores through the game
- [x] user can view high scores on their profile page
- [x] point accumulation system in-play, + calc points per safe cells revealed, 
- [x] button to show high scores
- [x] if user logged in, can save high score (post to user array)
- [x] profile page where scores can be displayed
- [x] create a 'start game' landing screen with 'new game', 'set difficulty' and 'high scores' buttons
- [ ] have 8-bit chiptune stylized music play during game (with button that starts and stops music, maybe a speaker pic that gets struck through)
- [ ] volume increase/decrease for music
- [ ] play through and can play next song in list
